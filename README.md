# ProtonDatalabs AI developer Assignment - Chatbot application

## Project structure

In this project you find 2 directories

1. `backend` containing the server side **python** code
2. `frontend` containing the client side **typescript** code.

### Backend

**Requirements**: Python 3.10 or above. We will test your submission against Python 3.10.

1. `main.py` which is the entry point to our server
2. This project has a few Python packages as dependencies, you can install them in your virtual environment using `requirements.txt`. If you were to use other dependencies, then please add them to `requirements.txt`.
3. We will be using [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/) package manager to create a virtual environment `chatbot` using `conda create -n chatbot python=3.10` and then `conda activate chatbot` to activate the environment.
4. Then install the python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This backend uses the approach

1. **Data Ingestion**: Files containing unstructured text data are ingested using the `data_ingestion()` function. The UnstructuredFileLoader class loads documents from files. The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class splits documents into smaller text chunks to handle large documents effectively.
2. **Embedding and Indexing**: Text chunks are embedded using OpenAI's language model via the OpenAIEmbeddings class. Pinecone, a vector similarity search service, is utilized to build an index for efficient retrieval. The Pinecone class is used to create a Pinecone index from the embedded text chunks.
3. **Retrieval and Question Answering**: Queries are processed through the chatbot using the `chatbot()` function. The `retrieval_answer()` function retrieves answers to queries by leveraging the embedded text chunks indexed in Pinecone. Language Model:
* Utilizes OpenAI's language model for understanding queries (via the ChatOpenAI class).
* Retrieval QA System: Combines the language model and the Pinecone index to retrieve relevant answers to queries (via the RetrievalQA class).


#### Running the backend server

To launch the server, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

##### `uvicorn main:app --reload`

This will start the server at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

### Frontend

The project structure within the `frontend` directory follows the official `create-react-app` structure as in the [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure). Some of the files have been removed for convenience & brevity.

**Requirements**: We are using `node V20.11.1` and `npm 10.2.4`. They can be downloaded via [installer](https://nodejs.org/en). For more information check [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### How to launch the react app

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install`
2. Then you can run:

   ##### `npm start`

   This will launch the app in development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## The assignment

### Backend

1. Currently, the server returns `hello world!` everytime user makes a query, which needs to be changed. Modify the `/predict` endpoint to acheive this. You are free to use any architecture here: API based or open-source LLMs. The end goal in either case is to have a meaningful result based on the user query and uploaded file.
2. Implement the storage and handling of the incoming files from the frontend. You can use any database management system like MongoDB or MySQL for this.

### Frontend

1. Add a pop up which notifies that the file has been uploaded properly.
2. Extend the app's functionality to accept `.txt`,`.docx` & `.pdf` files in addition to `.csv` files.
3. Add some styling to the bare bones app structure. You are free to use any popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind or UI libraries like Material or Chakra UI. Bonus points for creative and innovative designs.
